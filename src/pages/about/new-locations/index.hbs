      <p>HTHWt is currently available qith limited resources at this time, with more locations interested in going live soon as well as platform updates.</p>

      <p>We have designed the website and apps so that they can run across multiple locations, and eventually nationally. We are a small team, and we want to expand in a way that is sustainable. We focus on places where the local network tell us this is needed and would add value to what is already happening. If you feel HTHW would be useful to you in your local area, please read the brief guide below on what is involved and <a href="/about/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <p>There are 4 steps to successfully launch HTHW in a new location:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The local network confirms this is NEEDED - they commit to enter their organizations information and bring in their connections to other services.</li>
        <li>We configure HTHW for the new location, for this we require a small donation of $10. At this point, the basic find help and give help functions can be used by frontline workers.</li>
        <li>Engage a local Comms/PR partner or group of volunteers - spread awareness with people who are homeless and the public.</li>
        <li>Find a local sponsor to contribute to our ongoing monthly running costs - this could be through a local business, council, a philanthropist or an institution.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you are interested in bringing HTHW to where you live, or if you have any questions or suggestions about this, please <a href="/about/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <p>HTHW is an independent organization that is a trusted source of information on homelessness in our featured locations. In order to maintain a good standard of information, we only list organizations that match our values.</p>
  
      <h2 class="h2">Registering Your Organization</h2>
      <p>If your organization is not yet listed, you can <a href="/register">register your organization's key details here</a>. Please note we are only currently active in selected locations.</a>.</p>
      <p>Once registered, you can <a href="https://helpthehomelessworldwide.org">log into the administration area</a>, and update your information there.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">HTHW are not in my area yet</h3>
      <p>Listing your services is just the first step; to discuss how HTHWt Network can help your city can work in partnership, and create long lasting solutions through co-production, please <a href="mailto:support@hthcoin.world">contact support@hthcoin.world</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">My Organization is already listed; how do I update the information?</h2>
      <p>Our researchers may have already added your organization and services. To get a login to update the information yourself, please contact <a href="mailto:business@hthcoin.world">business@hthcoin.world</a>.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">I've forgotten my password</h3>
      <p>To reset your password, you should use the "Don't remember your password?" link, on the login form.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">I've noticed something wrong with the information on the site</h2>
      <p>Please note, all information is provided by organizations in the network. Whilst we do all we can to support, it is really important that organizations update their own service details if they change. Please <a href="/about/contact">get in touch</a> if you spot anything that is incorrect or missing.</p>

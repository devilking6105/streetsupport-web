      <p>During periods of severe cold weather, additional emergency accommodation is provided by councils. We are aiming to provide A Bed Every Night for people who are homleless in Linwood. Find out more at <a href="http://streetsupport.net/gm">streetsupport.net/gm</a>.</p>

      <p>When there is severe weather, additional emergency beds are made available for people to move inside.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the day, call the Atlantic County Women's Center on <a href="tel:6096466767">609 646 6767</a>.</li>
        <li>Out of hours you can refer via the duty social worker <a href="tel:6096466767">609 646 6767</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are outreach workers covering different areas in the city to connect with people who are homeless and helping them to get inside if possible. Each individual is assessed so that appropriate accommodation can be found based on their needs.</p>
